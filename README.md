# 3D Pose Estimation Using AlphaPose and MotionBERT

This repository contains a setup for 3D pose estimation integrating two powerful models: AlphaPose for 2D pose estimation and MotionBERT for 3D pose estimation. Below are the guidelines for setting up and running the project.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure to set up the environment by following these guides:

- [AlphaPose GitHub Repository](https://github.com/MVIG-SJTU/AlphaPose/tree/master)
- [MotionBERT GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Walter0807/MotionBERT/tree/main)
- [Additional AlphaPose Setup Instructions](https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_44848751/article/details/132140935)

Ensure that all necessary libraries are installed and that the model weights are correctly placed in their respective directories as detailed in the GitHub repositories.
**Note:** Use the code sent to you as it has been significantly modified from the original versions available on GitHub. This ensures compatibility and correct functioning of the integrated system.

## Project Structure

- **AlphaPose Folder**: Contains the modified AlphaPose code from the [AlphaPose GitHub](https://github.com/MVIG-SJTU/AlphaPose/tree/master).
- **MotionBERT Folder**: Contains the MotionBERT code from the [MotionBERT GitHub](https://github.com/Walter0807/MotionBERT/tree/main).
- **Data**: This directory includes several subfolders:
  - **Original Video**: Place your videos here.
  - **Ground Truth**: Place ground truth JSON files here.
  - **AlphaPose 2D Output**: Stores the 2D JSON output generated by AlphaPose.
  - **Trimmed Videos**: Stores the first 10 seconds of the original videos, trimmed.
  - **MotionBERT 3D Output**: Stores the 3D NPY files generated by MotionBERT.
  - **Ground Truth Calculated Angles**: Excel files containing ground truth angles for each exercise and consolidated.
  - **MotionBERT Calculated Angles**: Excel files containing angles calculated by MotionBERT for each exercise and consolidated.
 - **Calculate_Angle.py**: This script calculates angles from 3D JSON/NPY files.
 - **Calculate_MPJAE.py**: This script calculates MPJAE between the  ground truth angles and predicted angles.

## Running the Code

1. **Set Up Environment**: Follow the above guides to install the necessary libraries and place model weights.
2. **Prepare Data**: Add your videos and JSON ground truth files to `Data/original Video` and `Data/Ground Truth` respectively.
3. **Run AlphaPose**:
   - Navigate to the AlphaPose folder.
   - Modify input-output directories in `main.py`.
   - Execute `main.py`. It processes the first 10 seconds (approximately 503 frames) of each video, outputting 2D JSON files to `Data/AlphaPose 2D Output`.
4. **Run MotionBERT**:
   - Navigate to the MotionBERT folder.
   - Adjust directories in the main script.
   - Execute the script to generate 3D pose output (NPY files) from 2D JSON outputs, stored in `Data/MotionBERT 3D Output`.
5. **Calculate Angles**:
   - Execute `Calculate Angles.py` to compute various angles.
   - The results are saved directly in the Data folder.
   - Individual Action Files: For each action, an individual file is created that contains the computed angles.
   - Consolidated Files: Two consolidated files are created:
   - MotionBERT_processed: Contains data processed from MotionBERT's output, where the first frame's data has been subtracted from the rest of the frames in each action sequence to reduce initial bias.
   - Ground_Truth_Processed: Similar processing is applied to the ground truth data, with the first frame's data subtracted from the subsequent frames to address initial bias.
     
6. **Evaluate MPJAE**:
   - Run `Calculate MPJAE.py` to calculate the Mean Per Joint Angle Error (MPJAE) between ground truth and MotionBERT's predicted results. The output will be stored in the Data folder in Excel format.
